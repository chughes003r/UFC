# UFC fight optimization code
This was a fun little project in which I was trying to use fighter data publicly available with TensorFlow/Keras to make predictions about which fighters would win their fights. 
Based on their odds/cost in DraftKings, this code could try to produce "optimal line ups."
Seemed to work okay in that it would select obvious likely winners, but fights are notriously hard to predict.
